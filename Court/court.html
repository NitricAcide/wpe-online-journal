                <p>This activity was hosted with our youth fellowship group after a Sunday service. It was an event to bond with together with the youth church members. Pickleball was a sport that was chosen simply because it's been a hot topic lately here in Dumaguete City, considering the amount of pickleball courts that you can find around the city. This was on the 21st of September on a pickleball court near my place, which is nearby Ace Doctors.</p>
                <p>From what I've experienced, Pickleball is a sport that combines the elements of tennis, table tennis and badminton together. I was allowed to play along with a friendly match against other youth members. It was my first time playing this sport and I found it to be quite fun and engaging once I got the hang of how the sport works and all of it's rules. I truly think that playing sports without being too competetive is a funner experience for sports like this.</p>
                <p>I hope to continue to bond with my fellow youth members of the church through different sports and acitvities in the future. It was definitely a fun experience to be with the presence of other people and do something active together.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I was able to try out a new sport and bond with people who I know and grow closer to them.

                <p>Karatedo is a martial art sport from what I've read, means "the way of the empty hand". It was one of the many sport events that were held in celebration of the Buglasan festival by our provincial governor, Gov. Chaco Sagarbarria. It was a 2 day event that I believe to have started in October 11th and ended on the 12th of October, with the venue being the NORSU Gymnasium.</p>
                <p>Upon entering the gymnasium, I saw alot of athletes who were relatively young, probably ranging from elementary to as old as freshmen. I was quite surprised considering that I used to think that a sport involving martial arts is usually a competition between more experienced adults. So it's quite a pleasant surprise to see young athletes in this sport a chance to compete in this kind of setting.</p>
                <p>Watching the matches, I was quite amazed with the athleticism displayed especially to the young athletes. While I am not quite athletic myself nor am I familiar with how martial arts work, I can appreciate that this kind of sport is quite engaging to watch, which kind of inspired me a little to maybe start build up some athleticism myself while I am still young.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I was able to witness young athletes showcase their skills in martial arts and appreciate the sport that is Karatedo.</p>

                <p>The Inter-town Volleyball was another sport event and organized by the governor for the Buglasan festival. It is called inter-town because it features all the teams that hail from different towns and cities around the province. It was a week-long event that started on October 14 on the Agan-An covered court in Sibulan, near the airport.</p>
                <p>We watched a match of Sibulan against Pamplona, where both teams were already quite sweaty and active by the time we arrived for the match. I've always watched volleyball games and find them to be quite engaging and intense to watch especially when both teams are evenly matched. This match was no different as both teams were giving their all to win the match for their respective towns. In the end, Sibulan won the match.</p>
                <p>Watching this match made me appreciate volleyball even more as a sport, seeing how both teams were giving their all to win the match for their towns. It also made me want to play volleyball sometime soon, considering that I haven't played volleyball in a long time since highschool.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I was able to witness a competitive volleyball match between two towns and appreciate the sport even more.</p>

                <p>Chess is another sport event that was organized by our provincial governor for the Buglasan festival. It was held at the NORSU Gymnasium on October 18th. It was held pretty early on the morning so they were still preparing and even experienced a blackout as well, yet they still continued on with the event.</p>
                <p>Watching the chess tournament of alot of players involved was quite intriguing. It's a sport that involves a lot of strategy and thinking. I used to play chess diligently back when I was still a child but fell off when my interests started to shift and I started to focus on other things. Seeing the players play in this tournament and watching how they play, their pieces in the board kind of also allowed me to play along by thinking of what moves I would do if I were in their position.</p>
                <p>Watching the chess tournament involving both young and old players was an entertaining experience because it allowed critical thinking and strategy to be displayed in a competitive setting, which is usually dominated by sports that emphasize on physical athleticism. It kind of also felt like I was part of playing the game too as I was thinking of strategies alongside the players.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am able to appreciate the sport of chess and the strategic thinking that it involves.</p>

                <p>We arrived at the court where matches were already playing. We witnessed the starting of a match between two players who were quite young. I watched as both these players compete and was fun to watch as one of them would scream or rather just make some noise whenever she would score a point. In the end, that little girl who made the noise won the match. But what was heartwarming to see was the display of sportsmanship between both players as they came together and high fived each other after the match was over.</p>
                <p>This display of sportmanship between these two players is one of the reasons I appreciate watching sports event because of the values displayed between the players.

                <p>This table tennis tournament was yet another sport event organized by our provincial governor for the Buglasan festival that we attended. It was held on the October 18th in the Incredoball sports and development center here in Dumaguete City.</p>
                <p>Upon arriving at the venue, I saw quite a few players who were already competing with such intensity as they play and move around the table. Table tennis is a sport that my little sister is quite fond of playing, so I am quite familiar with the game yet I'm not quite good at it myself. Though, watching the players play with such intensity and focus even when one of them were behind in score was quite inspiring to see. It showed me how much these athletes give their all to win even in the face of adversity.</p>
                <p>Watching the table tennis tournament was quite a site, seeing the different players showcase their athleticism on a table. It was also inspiring to witness their unwavering determination to win the match even when they were losing.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I witness the athleticism and determination displayed by the table tennis players in the tournament.</p>

                <p>This football match was part of a sports event for the senior high school of Silliman University, which is Pasiklaban. It's a sport's event that they seem to celebrate anually, where there a lot of different teams that were subdivided from different sections in the SHS department. This particular match was a matchup between the Midnight Crusaders (purple)  and the Azure Athenians (aquamarine). It was a match that featured both the men and women of both teams competing in separate games but on the same field. I was invited by my sister who was part of the Azure Athenians, to come and watch the match.</p>
                <p>Watching the match was entertaining, I get to witness the fervor of both teams as their respective team members cheer for motivation and support. The match exemplified the competetive nature of sports, as I witness both teams giving their all to win the game for their respective teams.
                <p>This football match has given me the experience once again of the fervor of cheering for a team as I witness the different students giving their all to make some noise of support for their team. It made me appreciate the football match even more because of it.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I was taken back to what it felt like to cheer for a team and witness the competetive spirit even as a young student.</p>
