                <p>This convocation was held on the 30th of July at the Luce auditorium, it featured a lot of the people in the university such as the different department heads, the dean, and the university president. It was an event that is meant to welcome the students for the new school year.</p>
                <p>I attended this event along with a friend of mine. Was quite surprised with the long list of leaders and deans reminded me how much dedication and teamwork that's involved to keep the university running. Dr. Alvarez's warm welcome spoke in a way that connected the personal memories of Dumaguete with the idea that learning begins with trust and shared purpose. I think in a sense, it makes me proud to see that Silliman is embracing the changing global trends in education, like the initiative of digital transformation and AI integration. It shows how the university is committed to not only preserving its legacy, but leading in preparing its students for the future.</p>
                <p>The convocation has gave me validation on what higher education should be, that it's not just about academic achievement, but also nurturing the trust, community and adaptability in an ever changing world. Being in Silliman for nearly all of my academic life, I grew up witnessing these changes and adaptability of the university. Hopefully I can apply the message of being more proactive and appreciating how technology can enhance education.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am more inspired to trust the process of learning, embrace the innovation with faith and take part in Silliman's ongoing of excellence.</p>

                <p>This book reading activity was held on September 25 to October 2, a whole week given to us to read a book that is related to anything in computer studies. I chose after reading the countless catalogues, "Low Tech Hacking". This was an activity to be done for the WPE subject to showcase the value of classroom in the 5 C's of Silliman, as well as equip us with skills in accessing the library for resources.</p>
                <p>The book "Low Tech Hacking" is a book that basically explores the often overlooked vulnerabilities in security systems that doesn't always involve the use of advanced tools or technical expertise. Yet, the book also highlights the different ways in which these low tech methods can be used for ethical purposes, as well as granting awareness to these methods and how to combat them. It expresses the greater importaance of human factors that are involved in security so that we should be more vigilant and aware in what we do to keep ourselves secure.</p>
                <p>This activity has taught me how to properly access the library and its resources, but moreso, it has given me a deeper appreciation for the value of reading and self learning. In this age of information overload, it's easy to get lost in the sea of content available online. However, taking the time to read a book allows for a more focused and immersive experience. It encourages critical thinking, reflection and a deeper understanding of specific subject matter. I'd say this activity has given me a better appreciation for the value of reading and self learning, as well as the importance of being able to access reliable resources through the library.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am more motivated to continue reading and exploring new topics, knowing that the library is a valuable resource that can aid in my journey of learning.</p>

                <p>This activity was held on the first of August and was an activity for our WPE that enhances our knowledge on the history of Silliman University. It involved reading the book "The First Quarter" by Dr. Hibbard, which details the history of Silliman and its development through the years. I read this in the library and for the first time, access the Sillimaniana section and was greeted warmly by the staff there.</p>
                <p>Reading the book in the library had been an enlightening experience. It showed a greater depth of faith and perseverance shown by the early founders of the university, especially how they built a strong educaion institution amidst the limited resources and cultural differences. Sitting in the Sillimaniana section, alone with the book and silence, I felt a deeper sense of focus and connection with the book and appreciating how far Silliman has come. Dr. Hibbard's dedication and vision, passion for education and service when reading the book, left a strong impression on me. It reminded me that values like faith and excellence in not just fulfilling not just about the mission of the university, but they are continuing responsibility that we inherited and live out.</p>
                <p>This book reading experience has deepened my appreciating of history and how it shapres the present, especially that being a student of Silliman, just attending classes is already carrying on a legacy of purpose. I learned the importance of vision and perseverance, especially in times of challenge and would hope to apply this mentallity by embodying the Silliman spirit through an examplary of service and excellance.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am made aware of the rich history I am part of and more committed to living out the same spirit of faith, learning and service that Dr. Hibbard envision when he established Silliman University.</p>

                <p>This is the founder's week opening devotion held on 26th of August. We were called to gather on an early morning to attend this event at the front of our college building. It was an event that marks the beginning of the week-long celebration of Silliman's founding anniversary. Afterwards, we were given breakfast to eat after the opening devotion.</p>
                <p>The devotion was basically an opening for prayer and guidance as we begin to celebrate the founding week of Silliman. It gave us messages of encouragement as we start the week ahead filled with activities and events. It's just a reminder that amidst the busyness of the week, we should always take the time to reflect and seek guidance from God. The devotion I believe highlights the spirit of coming together from across different departments to celebrate and maintain our shared identity as Sillimanians.</p>
                <p>In a sense, this activity has showed me take a moment to pause and reflect amidst the busyness of school life. Showing me the importance of seeking the strength and guidance from God as we navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am reminded to always seek guidance and strength from God in all that I do, and to approach each day with a spirit of gratitude and reflection.</p>

                <p>Each speaker shared their unique journey, challenges and successes during and after their time in Silliman. From what I gathered, they all emphasized the importance of perseverance, continuous learning and staying true to one's values. Even if times get tough, the skills and what they've learn in the college and Silliman have equipped them to find ways to be successful in their careers. It gave me and probably others the spark of motiviation to pursue our own passions and dreams, knowing that with hard work and dedication, we can achieve great things.</p>
                <p>The lecture has given me valuable insights and inspiration from the experiences of successful alumni.

                <p>This activity was part of the different events hosted by the student council. Particularly, students were to gather and play different board games and make new friends. It was held last August 27 at the college building.</p>
                <p>The event was a fun and engaging way to foster creativity and social interaction among students. It provided an opportunity for students to come and gather together, and engage in activities that stimulate their strategic thinking and creativity through board games. In here, I was able to play along with different people in the department and experience a new type of game that I haven't played before. A refreshing experience that allowed me to step away from the technology-focused environment and have a genuine connection and fun with others.</p>
                <p>To me, this activity has highlighted the importance of creativity and social interaction in a student's life. It has shown me that taking time to engage in having fun and connection with others can enhance our overall well-being and foster a sense of community here in the college.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am more motivated to seek out opportunities for creativity and social interaction, knowing that they can contribute to a well-rounded and fulfilling college experience.</p>

                <p>The Mental Health Caravan was an event that was advertised for freshmen to attend, featuring Dr. Carl Gerard Yap, a psychiatrist who'll be giving a lecture on builfing a mental health toolkit for the first year college students to prepare them for the college life. It was held on October 8 at the Luce auditorium.</p>
                <p>During the Mental Health Caravan, I learned valuable insights on how to manage stress, self regulation and building resilience through the practical mental health tools that Dr. Yap has shared. He was able to be relatable and connect with students by his examples of students facing academic pressure, homesickness and procrastination. I think what was impactful to me was the mindfulness exercise, which gave us a few minutes of peace and focus inside the auditorium. It made me more mindful of slowing down and being present in the moment, showing importance of self-care and balanced and realize that mental wellness is not something selfish, but an essential part of growth and success in college.</p>
                <p>This experience has showed me the importance about mental health. I used to think that managing stress was purle about avoiding pressure, but I learned that it's about facing challenges with healthy copying strategies. The Mental Health Caravan reminded me that resilience is built through small, consistent acts of care and self-awareness. I hope to apply what I've listened by being more mindful of my mental well-being and seek support when needed.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am more aware of my own mental health, more equipped with tools to handle the academic and life's pressures, and more committed to building resilience in myself and in those around me.</p>
