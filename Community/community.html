                <p>This activity was proposed to us as a way for us to donate to the less fortunate by preparing different supplies and goods for them. It was an activity held on October 22, in our classroom to prepare for gifting to the Sto. Niño orphanage.</p> 
                <p>We, as a group, prepared different goods such as food, toiletries, and other essentials that we were told to bring and donate. We all worked together to prepare the goods and pack them properly on a box. We then proceed to cover it in gift wrap and each of us wrote a letter designating it to the children in the orphanage, in hopes that the things we prepared would be of help to them.</p>
                <p>This activity was a great way for us to give back to the community and help those in need. It was a humbling experience that reminded us of the importance of kindness and generosity. I hope that the things we donated would be of help to the children in the orphanage.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I was able to give back to the community and help those in need. It was a humbling experience that reminded me of the importance of kindness and generosity.</p>

                <p>For this activity, I wanted to do another form of donation and I scoured in Facebook and found a post about an unfortunate fire that engulfed a student dorm which burned their belongings. I decided that I wanted to donate to them and led the initiative to collect things to donate from my family and relatives. This occured on October 26th after sunday service and had asked for donations from the people in church for a good cause. Along the way, it changed becaused the people weren't present when we arrived to the area.</p>
                <p>Knowing that the people weren't there after checking and asking the nearby residence, I asked my father to whom I could donate all the things we collected. He suggested that we donate to the porters in Dumaguete City, who are stationed near the Port of Dumaguete. I think the reason why he suggessted this because I knew my father travels alot and as he grows old, carrying his belongings has become harder for him to do. Throughout the years of traveling, he had made personal connections with many of the porters there and weren't just relationships of being transactional. I know that he tends to overspend on them sometimes just because he can and knew that they needed it. So I thought that it would be a good idea to donate to them since they work hard for a living and I wanted to help them in any way I can.</p>
                <p>In this donation experience, I was I guess quite nervous because I'm not a social person but yet the porters were so kind and grateful for knowing what we were doing that I felt goodness in my heart. Another thing is that I am very empathetic and seeing other people's situations makes me feel sad for them. So doing this donation on behalf of the people who entrusted me to make good use of them made me feel more elated, knowing that I was able to help these people and make a positive impact in their lives.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I was able to lead an initiative to help those in need by being entrusted the responsibility of people's donations and giving it to those who deserve the help they need.</p>

                <p>This activity, I decided to clean my neighborhood, considering the road I pass through everyday, there is a lot of trash and litter that accumulates on the sides of the road. I wanted to do something about it so I spent an hour or two just roaming around and picking up trash. I did this after my exams to relax and unwind from the stress of studying.</p>
                <p>I brought a trash bag with me and collected as much trash as I could find. I asked my sister to record me while I roam around picking up unproperly disposed trash. It was a definetely tiring to do, walking around underneath the sun and picking up litter made me appreciate the garbage collectors who do this kind of work for a living. I could not dispose of all the trash in my neighborhood but I at least felt good knowing that I was able to make a small difference in my community by keeping my neighborhood clean.</p>
                <p>Through this experience, I was able to work with sweat and effort to clean my neighborhood by cleaning the trash scattered around. It made me appreciate the people who do this kind of work daily and made me more conscious of my own actions when it comes to disposing my own trash.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am able to make a small difference in my community through my effort of cleaning the neighborhood as well as an experience of self-reflection of the importance of cleanliness and appreciation for those who do this kind of work.</p>
