                <p>This is event was the All-University Midweek Service that was held on the first day of October 2025. It was held on night time at our University's Church and it's basically a session that brings the university community together and reflect with our relationship with God. It also puts an emphasis to the university's educational philosophy of being anchored to the gospel and develops the whole person of the students who attend.</p>
                <p>The message from this service was given to us by Dr. Giovanni T. Macahig, which was titled as "God Cares". It was a very nice message that gave me a moment to pause and reflect on how deeply God's care is present in my everyday life, especially in times of stress and exhaustion as a student. The part where we spoked about Elijah's despair and how God cared for him not through grand miracles, but through a quiet whisper and simple bread and water. It’s a story that is reflective with life because of how God’s help often comes in gentle, unseen ways. A difficult part in the service was confronting how often I’d rely only on my own strength, especially on group projects in school, as I try to burden myself with all the responsibility. But the way the speaker delivered his message was calm and genuine, which led me to think that he understood the hidden burdens that we students carry. This service showed me the value of faith and compassion that is expressed through prayer and recognizing that God’s care also calls for the care of others</p>
                <p>This service I guess broadened my worldview by reminding me that faith is not only about believing in God’s power, but to also be trusting in his timing and quiet presence. God’s not always dramatic in the things he does, but it can be found in the daily strength, encouragement from others or even the courage to take one step to do something. I hope that in the future, I can apply this line of thinking to be more attentive and be an instrument of God’s care to others by offering help and look forward to future UCLEM services so I can stay connected with the community of faith in this university.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am made more aware that God’s care is constant and real, often revealed in quiet ways. It encouraged me to trust him more deeply and to stop delaying the care that he offers and be a channel of the same care he gave me, to others.</p>

                <p>This sunday sermon was held on the 31st of August which was held on our church, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Calvary-Downtown-61551410155855/">Calvary Downtown</a>, a small church yet growing church that mine and other families started as a branch off from another church in Dumaguete City. I was tasked to be the person in charge of displaying the projector, which means I handle the slides for the lyrics that'll be sang on the praise and worship, for the sermon and the closing worship. Our Pastor, Jing Gayaden was someone whom my father encouraged to be our shepherd for when we were starting this church and I am very proud of how much our church has grown and the people we've brought over and spread the word of God.</p>
                <p>This sermon's theme helped me gain a deeper understanding of how faith can be tested in subtle ways, not just through persecution or suffering, but also through compromise and deception. It's surprising how the message was very relevant to modern life. Pastor Jing has emphasized that the "beast from the earth" represents the false prohets or the systems that look good and persuasive from the outside but draw people away from the truth. It made me realized how easy it is to be influenced by trends, media, or opinions that seem harmless but can slowly weaken our faith. It helped me understood that true wisdom lies in discernment, which is to learn to recognize truth from deception by staying grounded in God's word. Pastor Jing cleverly relates the scripture to real-world examples that helped us see that the "mark of the beast" is not just a symbol, but a warning against losing our allegience to God. It taught me to value of vigilance and to remain faithful even when the truth is unpopular.</p>
                <p>The sermon has showed me the importance of discernment. It taught me that faith requires awareness, courage and wisdom to be able to stand firm against deception that may appear good or popular. Everything that is seen as "good" not always aligns with God's truth, staying close to his word is the only way to gaurd the heart and mind. Moving forward, I plan to apply this learning by being more intentional in what I consume, be it media, beliefs or influences. I  want to be more grounded in the decisions through the teachings of God's word.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am more spiritually aware and more determined to live with discernment and faithfulnes. Not all that shines are true, real wisdom comes from staying rooted in God's word and resisting the deceits the world offers.</p>

                <p>This activity was held on Quezon Park on October 3, 2025. It is an annual event of celebration of the season of creation, which is a gathering of Chrstians to come and pray, reflect and act upon environmental issues. It is a call for a restored relationship between the people, God and Earth, by addressing the environmental and social injustice that is caused by human actions. I was invited by my teacher in CHS 3, Ma'am Alma Ruiz, to attend this event and I thought it would be a nice opportunity as a learning experience to understand how faith and environmental stewardship can be connected.</p>
                <p>The event showcased different kinds of performances and led the attendees to a journey of reflection by being actively involved. In this, we were greeted with three people who acted as representatives to the different values of what it would take to become environmentally aware. The first was a student from the student council of Silliman, who shared on the practice of being zero waste, combing through the importance of waste segregation and emphasizing the 5 R's of waste management. The second speaker was a farmer from what I believe, who spoke on the practice of health and awareness for all through farming and awareness, in which he emphasized on the people who are affected by the effects of environmental disasters, the farmers who share the fruits of the earth, and awareness to the leaders to be raised with integrity and justice for the people. The last speaker was a marine biologist who spoke on the protection marine biodiversity, which he highlighted on the mangroves and how they are important to the ecosystem as a whole, and as well as the call of action to protect the women whose dignities are denied and suffer from violence. All of these speakers came to give the attendees and opportunity to help by giving them an opportunity to talk it out. I was particularly interested in marine biodiversity and had hoped to take action in trying to preserve it.</p>
                <p>This event was a very nice experience for me as it showed me how serious people are when it comes to environmental issues, Caring for the environment is not just a matter of practicality, but also a spiritual responsibility. Faith had calls us to be stewards of the earth, to care for the creation that God has entrusted to us. It made me realized that environmental issues are not just scientific or political matters, but also moral and spiritual concerns. Moving forward, I plan to apply this learning by being more conscious of my actions and their impact on the environment.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am more aware of the interconnectedness of faith and environmental stewardship. It encouraged me to see caring for creation as an expression of my faith and a way to honor God’s creation.</p>

                <p>This sunday sermon was held on September 14 on our church, Calvary Chapen Downtown. At this time, I could not perform my duties to the projector because I was ill at this time, so I just attended the service posing as a regular church goer. As always, the sermon was delivered by our Pastor.</p>
                <p>The passage from Revelation that this sermon has focused on, shows a vivid picture of the end times through the vision of the three angels proclaiming urgent and eternal truths. The first angel carries the everlasting gospels, a calling of all nations to fear God, give him glory, and worship the Creator before the final judgement arrives. It shows of God's unwavering mercy that even in the darkest times of human rebellion, he still offers salvation and the chance to repent. The second angel announces the fall of Babylon, which represents the corrupt, idolatrous world systems that has intoxicated the nations with sin and decption. It shows how worldy power and moral decay will ultimately collapse under God's judgement. Finally, the third angel warns the eternal consequences for those who worship the beast and recieve its mark, which contrasts the temporary suffering of the saints with the eternal torment of the wicked. The passage is both terryifying yet comforting, because it reveals God's holiness and justice and the blessed hope for those who remain faithful. It showed me God's persistence of his grace even amidst the coming judgement.</p>
                <p>All three angels each share a message that calls for action and reflection. The first angel talks about to fear god and give him glory, reminding me that true worship begins with reverence and awe for God. The second angel's message about the fall of Babylon, challenges me to avoid being entangled in worldly values, materialsm and moral compromise because all of these things eventually leads to destruction. The third angel's warning is pressing on the urgency of the gospel, that if God still desires for his people to repent, even in the great tribulation, then how much more should we proclaim the gospel now, while grace is still freely offered. I am called to not be silent and complacent but to live and speak with conviction about the hope that is in Christ. Endure the trials, obey God, and keep my faith active through expressions of love and service to others.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am reminded that the message of Revelation is not just about prophecy, but also a call to be persevering, faithful and active in my faith. I hope to be more determined to live with this perspective and proclaim the word of Christ while there is still time, and remain steadfast even when the world grows darker.</p>

                <p>This sunday sermon was held on 21st of September at our church and was a special one because our pastor has invited a guest preacher who we at the church were already familiar with. Pastor Bill was a missionary from the United States who preaches the word of God from many parts of the world. He volunteered to be our pastor and share the word to us for one sunday. At this time as well, I am feeling well and was able to perform my duties of operating the projector for the sermon.</p>
                <p>Listening to pastor Bill's sermon, it was a message of something like "a miracle for you", which gave me a new perspective of how deeply God is involved in the smallest details of life. Pastor Bill intertwined his real missionary experiences, stories of hardship and the powerful reminder that God is both the maker and the saviour. What struck me the most was pastor Bill's passion in recounting how God sustained him through various trials like leading people to Christ in distant places, to witnessing the miraculous preservation of life. He gives authenticity and humility as he spoke not as someone mrely preaching theology, but as a living testimony of God's care. The message made me realize that miracles are not limited to extraordinary events, but that they happen in everday moments when faith is tested and God still provides.
                <p>It definetely showed me that miracles are not just divine interruptions but expressions of God's ongoing presence. I learned that faith is not proven when things go well, but when we still choose to believe even when we cannot see the outcome. I can apply this learning by being more midnful of God's work in my own circumstances, see his hand in ordinary blessings and respond with gratitude. </p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am made more aware of the miracles that are not just about what God does, but about who he is, someone who is faithful, personal and present in ever parts of my life.</p>

                <p>Our youth fellowship group is actually relatively still new. Started back in April, we were only encouraged to come together and form this youth group by our church's pastor. At the start, we didn't really know what to do, so our pastor offered up guidance for a few weeks or so until we were capable to be independent. Even so, we the youth are still inexperienced in preaching the word of God, so we seek help from others who are knowledgeable in the Bible and help us understand. Usually in these youth fellowships, we often start a call for worship (which is just singing songs to God), then reading the word of God, group reflection and finally closing worship. This particular fellowship session on September 13, we had a volunteer from the Calvary Bible college. He's of Vietnamese origin (forgive me, I forgot his name) and was very passionate in teaching to us the word of God.</p>
                <p>This youth fellowship's session continued on the book of John 3:22-36, where we were taught about appreciating humility and purpose in serving God. John the Baptist has said "He must increase, but I must decrease", which were words that made me realized the genuine faith is not about recognition but about pointing others to Christ. I was able to feel renewed and reminded that my worth is not refined by how others see me, but by my relationship with God. Everyone's reflection were very insighful as we show the different perspectives in how we interpret the message, yet center towards one theme of reminding ourselves that our purpose is to glorify God and not ourselves.</p>
                <p>This youth fellowship has reminded me that living for God often means letting go of pride and allowing him to take the lead. I think the passage is an allegory that spiritual maturity begins when one should stop competing for competition and start celebrating God's work in others. I hope I can apply this line of thinking by being more supportive of others' growth and let God's work in their lives be the focus, rather than my own achievements.</p> 
                <p>Because of this activity, I am more aware that following Christ means to lessen my own pride so that his light may shine brighter through me. Inspiring me to live with humility, serve others and let my life be a reflection of his glory.

                <p>This youth fellowship was held on September 27 on our house. Last time, it was held on our pastor's home residence, but my father offered up hospitality by letting us use our home as the venue for our youth fellowship. As always, we do the same routine and our speaker is still our Vietnamese friend from the Calvary Bible College.</p>
                <p>This day's passage focused on the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well, which gave a deeper understanding of God's love and acceptance. Jesus reached out to someone considered an outcast, which showed that his grace knows no boundaries, he sees beyond our past mistakes and offers us living water, a new beginning. It's surprising that Jesus intentionally met the woman at the well, which is to show that no one is too far for his love. A great message that expressed the value of compassion and openness by listening to others without judgement and reflecting on how one can extend the same kindness Christ showed to the Samaritan woman at the well. </p>
                <p>As a follower of Christ, I should reach out with empathy rather than judgement, just as Jesus did with the Samaritan woman. I want to apply this learning by being more welcoming and supportive to others in my daily life, especially to those who feel excluded or unworthy.
                </p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am reminded that God's love reaches everyone, no matter their past. I am inspired to be a vessel of that love, by listening, accepting and to share the living water that Jesus freely offers to all.</p>

                <p>Today's youth fellowship was held on October 11, 2025 back to our pastor's home residence. Same routine like always and we were all asked by our pastor about participating helpers for the upcoming Hope4You concert happening on November 22, hoping that we can lend a helping hand in handling the prayers and wishes of the youth during the concert.</p>
                <p>This youth fellowship session cenetered on how one encounter with Jesus can transform not just an individual but also an entire community. It talks about the Samaritan woman, after meeting Jesus, immediately shares her experience with others, leading many to believe in him. Even someone once shamed or ignored can become a messenger of God's truth. God can use anyone, regardless of their past of status, to bring others closer to him. It shows how I can also be a witness of God's goodness in my everyday life.</p>
                <p>This fellowship changed how I view my role as a believer, I learned that sharing my faith doesn't always mean preaching, but it can also be through my actions and the way I live. The Samaritan woman didn't have a theological thinking, yet her testimoney led others to Jesus. That truth encouraged me to stop doubting my ability to make a difference, but to apply this learning of being more intentional in showing Christ's love to others whtether through words or deeds.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am made more confident that God is able to use my story, no matter how ordinary it may seem, to bring others to him. Inspiring me to live as a testimoney of his transforming love and share his message.</p>
