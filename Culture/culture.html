                <p>The CCS Acquaintance party is an event held by the College to welcome the new students in the college life and help them get to know each other. It is an event that is held at the start of a new school year. The party was helld on the 2nd of August and the venue was in the Silliman University Junior Highschool, which is the school I attended during my junior high years so I was quite accustomed to the location.</p>
                <p>The event organizers encouraged the attendees to wear costumes that represent their favorite characters from either movies, TV shows, or video games. I didn't really had anything in my wardrobe that I could use as a costume, so I just wore an outfit that would reprsent those mafia characters from movies. I think the acquaintance party this year is a bit less grand compared to the previous years that I attended, but it was still a nice experience nonetheless. The event featured various activities for the students to participate in and have fun with, which they were encouraged to do so by getting stamped for each event that they participated so that they can get food earlier. To me, the main highlight is probably the food, as there was apparently a lot of food that was served at this party, more than enough that there was still alot of leftovers that some started to bring them home.</p>
                <p>This acquaintance party while not as what I would argue to be less memorable compared to the previous years, was still a fun experience for the freshmen to start off their college life.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I was able to witness the culture of giving importance to welcoming the freshmen students into the college community, showing the value of inclusivity and camaraderie among students.</p>

                <p>Buwan ng Wika is an annual celebration that is celebrated to promote the Filipino language and culture. It is celebrated every August in the Philippines. This particular celebration was held by the Senior High School department of Silliman University. I attended this event to support my younger sister as she was one of the students participating in the celebration.</p>
                <p>The event has featured many students wearing traditional Filipino clothing and showcasing the rich cultural heritage of the Philippines. Each class also held stalls that featured various Filipino cuisines, which I bought in support of the students (and to my sister). The Halo-halo is arguable one of my favorite Filipino desserts, and I was glad to see it being sold in one of the stalls.</p>
                <p>This event experience has given me a deeper appreciation for the Filipino culture and the importance of preserving our language and traditions. It was great to see the younger generation embracing and celebrating this cultural heritage.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I was able to witness the culture of celebrating and promoting the Filipino language and culture, showcasing the value of national pride and cultural preservation.</p>

                <p>The Parada Sillimaniana is a parade held during Silliman's Founder's Day celebration. This celebration was held on the 27th of August. It is a grand event that celebrates the university's history and spirit of the entire Silliman community. I participated the parade as one of the members who walked alongside my college's float. We walked for 4 hours around the city of Dumaguete, showcasing to the cityfolk the spirit of Silliman University.</p>
                <p>The parade featured various floats from different colleges and departments across the university. Each float was decorated with great amount of creativity and effort, showcasing the unique identity and spirit that they embody for each college. During the parade, we were entertained by the people who were lining the sidewalks, admiring and cheering on the performances and floats that passed by them. It was a great experience to be part of this parade as it was my first time participating in such an event.</p>
                <p>It was a first time experience for me to be part of the parade rather than just being a spectator. It was tiring walking for hours until we reached the end of the parade route, but I felt like it was worth it to witness the energy of the fellow Silliman community and the wondrous admiration of the cityfolk as we tour around the city.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I was able to experience what it was like being in a parade, and make everlasting memories representing my college while celebrating the university's history and spirit.</p>

                <p>The Parade of Lights or as known as "Parada Sa Kahayag", is a parade that happened in the Buglasan Festival on October 18. It featured floats from the across different cities in the province, touring around the capital city of Dumaguete at night. I attended this event along with a friend of mine after going around watching different sport games in the morning. The parade ended its route at the Rizal boulevard where we were able to witness the floats up close as they parked for spectators to admire and see.</p>
                <p>I was amazed by the display of creativity and effort that each city put into their float designs. Each of these floats center around a theme that represents each city's culture and identity. Like Dumaguete's Belfry Tower and Bais' dolphins and fishes in the sea. All of these floats were adorned with colorful lights that illuminated during the night, which I think enhanced the experience of watching them more. It was nice to see how much the people admire the floats that pass by, as they appreciate the people who danced and performed on the floats.</p>
                <p>This experience has led me to understood the importance of celebrating the local culture and identity of each city in the province. This parade was a great way to showcase the unique cultural heritage of each city and promote tourism in the province.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I became more appreciative of other cultures and traditions in the province, and learned the value of celebrating local identity to bring people together in celebration.</p>

                <p>The Buglasan Pyro Musical Competition was held on October 18, at the Rizal Boulevard coinciding with the Festival of Lights. They started really late and me and my friend were quite tired of waiting until we had to watch the parade of lights before they could officially start. We could not stay for long until the fireworks display has started because it would've been past our curfew, so we stayed for awhile listening to the different music that were performed.</p>
                <p>This event showcased a mixture of music and pyrotechnics where different teams showcased their fireworks display alongside the music. Watching from their livestream, each team had their own unique style of fireworks display especially in terms of the design and colors of the fireworks they used and the order in which they launched them to give a more dynamic experience.
                <p>The experience while although was limited by time constraints, I was still able to appreciate the fireworks through the livestream and even hearing the fireworks explosion from a distance from my home. Fireworks always gives a fun and memorable experience whenever I watch them, and while I couldn't fully appreciate the event in person, I was still glad to witness it through the livestream.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I was able to appreciate the art of pyrotechnics and music, and how they can come together to create a memorable experience for the people</p>

                <p>The Indayog Kultura was another event held during the Buglasan Festival on October 23, performed at the Freedom Park stage. It showcases various cultural dance performances from the Kahayag Dance Company. I visited this event with a friend of mine and witnessed the Filipino orchestra and the wondrous dance performances by the dancers. </p>
                <p>It was a cultural spectacle that showcased the different Filipino folk and traditional dances. From what I gathered, the Dance company performed these dances through a told story of courtship and revolution to celebrations of peace and identity. I'd also like to put emphasis on the orchestra who displayed skillful display in performing the accompanying Filipino music as well as the tailored costumes that the dancers wore which I think bring more authenticity to the performances. </p>
                <p>Watching the dancers who showed a great deal of passion as they dance with energy and grace was nice to see. It was like a trip down the history and culture of the Philippines expressed through the medium of dance and music.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I was able to appreciate the rich cultural heritage of the Philippines through dance and music, and learned the value of preserving and promoting traditional arts.</p>

                <p>This activity was more of a decision made out of the blue when I was going to attend the Buglasan Music Fest in Escaño street but due to bad weather and traffic, I could not navigate through the dense crowd nor find a suitable parking spot on the venue. So instead, I decided that on the next day I would take a stroll around the Buglasan Festival in freedom park on my own. It was on the last day of the festival on October 26 where a lot of people are around to witness the end of the festival.</p>
                <p>At this time, I was under a lot of stress from studying since it was exam week, and I was falling behind in my studies due to prior activities. On this day, I decided to go out to finish my culture journal entry by just taking a stroll around the festival area. I think that in some way, it helped relieve some streess as I took a stroll, taking in the scenery and the different festival booths, the colorful decorations and lights, and overall the lively atmosphere that is present in the festival. I only ever thought of doing this to finish my journal entry, but it turned out to be a nice experience that helped me relax a bit from the stress of studying.</p>
                <p>In some ways, this experience has taught me the importance of taking breaks and finding moments of relaxation amidst the busyness of life. It reminded me that sometimes, it's okay to take a step back and appreciate the joys of life found in simple activities like taking a stroll and enjoying festivities. Because of this, I was able to feel the energy of the festival and the people celebrating it, which in turn helped me feel less stressed.</p> 
                <p>Because of this activity, I am able to find moments of peace and enjoy the festivities even amidst my anxiousness, allowing me to appreciate the value of taking breaks and finding joy in simple pleasures.</p>
